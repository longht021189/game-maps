# Game Maps App

Welcome to **Game Maps**, an interactive tool for gamers to explore detailed maps powered by [Map Genie](https://mapgenie.io), with ads removed and pro features like unlimited save locations unlocked. I‚Äôm LongHT, a developer currently seeking new job opportunities, and I built this app for **Windows** as a passion project to showcase my skills‚Äîcontributions welcome to expand it to other platforms!

## Tech Stack and Why
- Tauri Framework: A cross-platform framework written in Rust, enabling lightweight and secure desktop applications.
- SolidJS: Chosen for its reactive programming model, which I enjoy (inspired by ReactiveX).
- C/C++: I‚Äôm more familiar with it than Rust, and it has fewer restrictions, such as Rust‚Äôs borrow checker rules.
- Catch2: A testing library for C/C++, used for writing unit tests.
- cURL: My favorite HTTP client library for its reliability and versatility.
- LevelDB: A simple, high-performance key-value database.
- yaLanTingLibs: A collection of C++20 libraries; I specifically used struct_json for JSON handling.

## Features

- **Interactive Maps**: Integrates with [Map Genie](https://mapgenie.io) for fan-made, detailed game maps.
- **Ad-Free Experience**: No distractions‚Äîjust pure map exploration.
- **Pro Features Unlocked**: Unlimited save locations to track all your in-game discoveries.
- **Sync Progress**: Seamlessly sync saved locations with Map Genie‚Äôs website.
- **User-Friendly Design**: Intuitive interface designed with gamers in mind.
